# ShinyRNAVisualizations
This project was adapted and completed privately by Dekel for the Handschind Lab's Nature Metabolism paper (by R. Furrer, et al. 2023).
The full project is hosted by Biozentrum here:  https://myo-trex.scicore.unibas.ch/

Ankita contributed greatly to get the initial project and idea going.


This Shiny app allows you to upload any matrix of RNA origin and receive interactive plots to observe the data deeply.
Data should be normalized prior to upload.
